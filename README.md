Solution overview
</h2>

The Agent for HR Service is designed to assist employees with various HR-related tasks. It provides instant answers, seamless record updates, and automated support, improving efficiency, compliance, and transparency by streamlining HR service workflows. 

This accelerator leverages Copilot Studio, Power Platform, and Microsoft Teams. It also interfaces with Dataverse and integrates the 3rd party business workflow management program, ServiceNow. 

The Agent enables employees to propose a relocation, compare benefits and compensation in different cities, and track the approval process. Upon completion of the relocation process, the company's records are updated and an automation is triggered wherein the Agent for HR Service will reach out for the employee's feedback, all using natural language inside of Microsoft Teams. 

**Note:** This accelerator is not intended to be a production ready solution. The components can be extended through customization and configuration as desired to create a production ready solution. All components packaged have been done through an unmanaged solution, which allows users to be able to customize and extend the components post-deployment. 

### Solution architecture

![Architecture](./Deployment/Images/architecture.png)

### How to customize

This solution is designed to be easily customizable. All configuration and customizations to this solution will be done in Power Platform, Copilot Studio, and with content and data stored in 3rd party platform ServiceNow.

**Additional opportunities for extension**

There are a variety of opportunities to extend the functionality of this accelerator. Some of these include:

 * Augmenting the sequence of steps involved in the relocation process, to match organizational practices
 * Catering for additional HR-related processes beyond relocations
 * Adapting or augmenting approval logic to match organizational practices
 * Integrating with additional systems of record for HR-related data and content
 * Integrating eSignature capabilities for document acceptance
    * An example of eSignature integration can be seen in the [Agent for Contract Processing Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent-for-Contract-Processing-Solution-Accelerator)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability - Do not have content**
 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./docs/QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

<br/>

### Prerequisites and Costs - Do not have content
{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific notes like role requirements}

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: {üü®TODO: Update with suggested regions specific to this solution}

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

{üü®TODO: Call out specific pricing "gotchas" like Azure Container Registry if known}

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific estimate sheet}

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/68b51f4cb79a4466b631a11aa57e9c16) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

<br/>

{üü®TODO: Update with all products, decription of product use, and product specific pricing links}

| Product | Description | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| [Product Name with Link to Learn content](https://learn.microsoft.com) | Decription of how the product is used | [Pricing]() |
| [Product Name with Link to Learn content](https://learn.microsoft.com) | Decription of how the product is used | [Pricing]() |

<br/>

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

Business Use Case
</h2>

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used:

![Key Features](./Deployment/Images/landingpage.png)

Pier, an employee of Contoso, is looking to relocate to a new city. Pier initiates contact with the HR agent to understand the relocation process and its potential impacts. The agent provides information on relocation compensation and helps Pier assess the financial implications. The agent offers to initialize a relocation request. Pier submits a relocation request through the agent. The HR team reviews and approves the request. Pier receives a notification in the Teams channel about the approval. The agent generates necessary documents for the relocation process. After the relocation process is complete, Pier receives an autonomous satisfaction survey to provide feedback on the interaction with the HR agent and the overall process

**Highlights**
- Knowledge Retrieval: The agent retrieves relevant information and documents from various sources, including SharePoint and ServiceNow
- Action Execution: The agent performs actions such as initiating requests, generating documents, and sending notifications
- System Integration: The agent integrates with existing HR systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and ServiceNow to provide a seamless experience. The agent can be customized to handle various HR scenarios, such as onboarding, offboarding, talent development, and performance management 

Overall, the HR Agent helps Pier by providing instant answers, automating routine tasks, and ensuring seamless integration with existing HR systems, thereby enhancing efficiency and the overall employee experience.
